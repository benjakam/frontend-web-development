# Frontend Web Development Masterclass

Welcome to the Frontend Web Development Masterclass, a comprehensive learning resource designed specifically for aspiring and active web developers. In this project I share and document my knowledge and experience of becoming a web developer. My goal is to motivate and inspire others to delve into the world of web development. This masterclass is always developing and receives continuous updates.

## Learning Content

Here is a list of all the learning content. The topics are structured from start to finish. The content is based on the [Frontend Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend?r=frontend-beginner) website.
I recommend following the curriculum if you are an absolute beginner. This makes it easier to build up structure at the beginning and not be overwhelmed by the amount of topics.
