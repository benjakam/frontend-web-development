## Introduction ðŸ“œ
The History of the Internet

Honestly, basically no frontend web developer has to deal with the history of the internet. But if you take a little time and go through the history, you will find many interesting inventions, such as Internet protocols and many other things that are still relevant today.

A chronology is the easiest and quickest way to understand The History of the Internet, so I created one.
In the process of creating a chronology, I created a website that shows the development of the Internet in a timeline. 
This website will then be continuously developed.

## Learning Process
- Describe what the internet is and how its work
- Create a chronology of the development of the Internet
- Create a first, simple, static HTML web page, which represents the chronology of the internet
- Create a list of relevant and helpful links about the history of the internet

## The Internet
What is the Internet and how its work?
The Internet is a worldwide computer network and connects computers with each other. It is designed to share electronic documents such as files, text, video and audio. Internet protocols are used for data transmission. The word Internet originated from the term "interconnected networks," and was also formerly known as "Internetwork."

## Chronology Of The Internet (The Most Important Years)
Russia sent Sputnik into space in 1957. There was the Sputnik crisis in the US and western countries in the late 50's and early 60's. In the course of this crisis, the [ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET) was developed, which contributed significantly to the emergence of the Internet.

1945:
The visionary [Vannevar Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush) fictitiously described a first step towards hypertext and personal computers in his book. [MEMEX (Memory Extender)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex). The idea was to display documents on two screens on the technological basis of (Micro)Photography. Today we know it as a static web page with hypertext. The pages should be connected with trails (today known as hyperlinks). His ideas continued to be an inspiration for the development of hypertext later in the 60's.

1960:
The military had the first networked computers and they are used internally to exchange data.

1965:
Universities are working on expanding and using the variants of the networking principle. The social scientist [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson) starts the [Project Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu) and [Hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext) is created.

1967:
[Larry Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Roberts_(scientist)) publishes the first work for the design of the [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET). [Donald Watts Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Davies) develops the [NPL network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPL_network) at the NPL (National Physical Laboratory), which experiments with [Packet switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching) 768 kb/s lines.

1969:
The first Internet protocols [RFC (Request for Comments)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) are created. This makes it possible to exchange information over four [Nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)). At that time it was the [ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET). It was developed by the US Department of Defense for the US Air Force.

1971:
The ARPANET is getting bigger and now has 15 nodes. In the same year, [Telenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenet) and [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) are developed.
A French project called: [CYCLADES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYCLADES) is also launched to advance Internet technology.

1972:
[Ray Tomlinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Tomlinson) develops the first e-mail program.

1973:
The [CYCLADES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYCLADES) project finds a new approach and publishes the [TCP protocol (Transmission Control Protocol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol).

1974:
The word [INTERNET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) is used for the first time in a document by [CYCLADES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYCLADES).

1975:
The [UUCP (Unix to Unix Copy) protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUCP) is born. It is used to exchange files between different computers, which are based on the [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) operating system.

1977:
The [TCP protocol (Transmission Control Protocol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) is subdivided and the [IP (Internet Protocol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) is created. Nowadays the IP protocol is used as the [internet layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_layer) and the TCP protocol is the [transport layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer). Both protocols are used to transport files over multiple connections (hops).

1978:
The [CBBS (Computerized Bulletin Board System)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBBS) is used to operate the first Mailbox.

1979:
The first transmissions by two [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) computers at different universities are made over the [telephone line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_line). This is the beginning of [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet), also known as a newsgroup.

1982:
[Randy Suess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Suess) makes the first Unix mailbox publicly available. Data is exchanged via [UUCP (Unix to Unix Copy) protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUCP).

1984:
The [DNS protocol (Domain Name System)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) is developed and the [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET) has meanwhile networked 1000 computers.

1985:
On January 1st, the very first [Domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name) in the world is registered. It is the domain: [nordu.net](https://nordu.net/). Research & Education Institutions connected in a network (NERN) to exchange information. The domain is still online today. 

1986:
Because different [Computer Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) are not yet able to communicate with each other, the Internet [backbone network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backbone_network) [NSFNet (National Science Foundation Network)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation_Network) is created.

1989:
[Tim Berners-Lee (TimBL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) best known as the inventor of the [WWW (World Wide Web)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) wrote and published his first draft of the development of the World Wide Web.

1990:
This year is a big turning point for the [INTERNET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) and several things are happening at once.

Since 1990, the Internet has not only been accessible in the military and at universities. The Internet will be made public and freely accessible to everyone.

The military [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET) is shut down.

Students from Canada program the first [search engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine) for [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) archives. They named it [Archie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_(search_engine)).

With the help of [Robert Cailliau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau), [Tim Berners-Lee (TimBL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) published the first concept for [Hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext) projects that can be used worldwide.

1992:
The first [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) is developed. It is the [Mosaic browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)) and it was published by the [NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing Applications)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Supercomputing_Applications).

1993:
The company [AOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL) makes [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) available to users.
Up to 500 [web servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server) worldwide are listed as online in October 1993.

1994:
[Tim Berners-Lee (TimBL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) founded the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium) it is an international standards organization for the World Wide Web.

1995:
Meanwhile, the [PC (Personal Computer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer) is developing rapidly. More and more users are accessing the Internet. There are now 3 million internet users. The [IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) [IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) are getting fewer, work is starting on [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6).

1998:
Two large and very influential Internet companies are founded.
[ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN)
[Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google)

2001:
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia) is founded and is still the largest online encyclopedia in the world

This is a summary of the most important events in the history of the Internet.
In my website project "Chronology of the Internet", I have many more interesting events and they are detailed in a timeline.
