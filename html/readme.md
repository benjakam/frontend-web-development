### About HTML
`H`yper `T`ext `M`arkup `L`anguage

HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages and describes the structure of a Web page. 
The structure is built with different elements to tell the browser how to display the content.

**HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not officially released.**

1995: HTML 2.0 was published

1999: HTML 4.01 was published - *(Major Version of HTML)*

2012: HTML5 was published

- HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information that can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not many of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.

- Then comes HTML 2.0, published in 1995, which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with that few additional features, which remained as the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.

- Then comes HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of the new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.

-  Then comes HTML 4.01, which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which is currently released and used worldwide. HTML 5 can be said for an extended version of HTML 4.01, which was published in the year 2012.

## HTML Basics

- An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag

- The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag
  
 start Tag - element content - end tag
 
`<html> html content </html>`

__NOTE__: Some HTML elements have no content, for example the `<br>` element

These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag! 

### Basic HTML Code
```sh
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Website Title</title>
</head>
<body>
 <h1>HTML</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
### !DOCTYPE
`<!DOCTYPE html>`

__All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE (html)> declaration__

The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.
